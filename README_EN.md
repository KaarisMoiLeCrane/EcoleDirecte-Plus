<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Web (chromium) extension For a Better EcoleDirecte Website.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Welcome ! Be happy to contribute !

### Prerequisites

There is no real prerequisite. You need Chrome or (maybe) just any web browser compatible with Chrome extension.

### Installation

The extension is 100% pure js and I want it to still be pure js. If you want to use any library you can but I will try (or you can try) to remake the functionalities you use from the library. Nevertheless, using very complex functionalities of a library is allowed (for example Chart.js).
See [Contributing](#contributing)

<!-- IMPORTANT -->
## Important

- This extension isn't affiliated at all with "ecoledirecte.com". I'm just a random guy who did this project.
- This extension needs the token of the account gived by EcoleDirecte to work (to get the homeworks status in the schedule). Any suggestions are opened if you have a better way and that work like it works right now. I'm actually working on a way to listen to the requests and then get the datas (for the grades and the homeworks in their pages only)
- All the changements are only visual. The website code isn't altered at all in any ways (no, html isn't a programmation language).
